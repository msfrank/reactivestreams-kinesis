reactivestreams-kinesis
=======================

[Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) is an initiative to provide a standard for asynchronous
stream processing with non-blocking back pressure on the JVM.  reactivestreams-kinesis
aims to implement the Reactive Streams Publisher and Subscriber interfaces for [Amazon Kinesis](http://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/),
so data may be produced to and consumed from Amazon Kinesis asynchronously.
